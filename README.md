__PrecisionRobotControl-Verilog__

__Overview__
   This project simulates an autonomous robot control system designed in Verilog, which allows a 
   robot to avoid obstacles using a distance sensor. It uses an ultrasonic sensor module to detect 
   obstacles and then controls motors based on the detected distance through PWM signals. The 
   system operates with a finite state machine (FSM) that directs the robot's movementsâ€”moving 
   forward, turning, or stopping.
